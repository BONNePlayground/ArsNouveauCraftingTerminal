### ✨ Features:

**Fixed GUI Glitches:**  
- Resolves the annoying issue where the expanded crafting terminal would glitch or misalign when scrolling through recipes or inventory items.
- Resolves the issue when changing screen size dropped filter options.
- Resolves the issue when changing screen size removed all tabs.

**Configurable GUI Sizes:**  
Choose your preferred crafting grid layout:

*   🟩 **Small** – 3 rows
*   🟦 **Medium** – 6 rows
*   🟥 **Large** – 9 rows

Each size provides smoother usability and better integration with different screen resolutions.

To operate the mod is required on both sides: client and server. However, mod is not required to join the server, and clients with mod can join servers without it.
